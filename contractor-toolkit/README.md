## 🛠️ The Legend of Skunk Works

**1943. World War II. America needed a jet fighter. NOW.**

Kelly Johnson grabbed 23 engineers and mechanics. Set up shop in a circus tent. Next to a plastics factory that reeked like a skunk.

**143 days later:** America's first jet fighter rolled out.

### The Rules That Built Legends:
- ✈️ **U-2 SPY PLANE**
- ✈️ **SR-71 BLACKBIRD** 
- ✈️ **F-117 NIGHTHAWK**

```
✓ Engineers work WITH mechanics
✓ Build it. Test it. Fix it. FAST.
✓ No bureaucracy BS
✓ Best idea wins - doesn't matter who
✓ The guy turning wrenches knows what's broken
```

## 📢 This Ain't Your Daddy's Suggestion Box

### EVERYTHING IS OPEN SOURCE
No black box. No buried ideas. Every suggestion is public. Your name on it. Credit where credit's due.

> **TRANSPARENT LIKE GLASS:**
> - Everyone sees what needs fixing
> - Management can't hide problems  
> - Your coworkers can back your ideas
> - When it ships, YOUR NAME is on it

---

## ⚙️ How It Works - AGILE STYLE

### 1️⃣ THE BACKLOG `[Master Build List]`
Every ticket goes here. Public. Visible. Prioritized by what matters.

### 2️⃣ THE SPRINT `[2-4 Week Blitz]`  
We grab the top items. Build them. Ship them. No waiting for annual updates.

### 3️⃣ THE RELEASE `[Your Fix Goes Live]`
Changes every few weeks. Not someday. Not next year. **NOW.**

## 📝 Submit Your Ticket - Two Ways

### Option 1: The Easy Button
Fill out the form. Takes 2 minutes. Your name attached.  
**[Submit Here](https://sites.plane.so/intake/ac4ac84cd43f48279722b6b07761ed79/)**

### Option 2: Go Direct to GitHub
For those who know their way around code. Same transparency. Same credit.

## 💯 Write It Like You Mean It

```
EXAMPLE TICKET:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Problem: Inventory scanner timeout - 30 seconds
Impact: Large shipments need 2+ minutes  
Frequency: 5-10 times per shift
Cost: 20 minutes wasted daily on re-scans
Submitted by: John "Maverick" Smith, Warehouse 3
```

### PRO TIPS:
- **One problem per ticket**
- **Be specific** - numbers matter
- **Multiple people with same issue?** Everyone submits = higher priority  
- **Got a fix idea?** Share it. Don't? That's fine too.
