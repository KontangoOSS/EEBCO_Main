# Open Source Like Skunk Works: Your Ideas, Your Credit

## The Skunk Works Story

Back in 1943, Lockheed needed to build America's first jet fighter in 143 days. Kelly Johnson handpicked 23 engineers and mechanics, set them up in a circus tent next to a smelly plastics factory (hence "Skunk Works"), and told them to ignore the bureaucracy and just build the damn thing.

**Their rules were simple:**
- Engineers work directly with mechanics
- Try something, test it, fix it, repeat
- No endless meetings or paperwork
- If someone has a better idea, implement it NOW
- The guy turning the wrench knows more than the guy behind the desk

They delivered the XP-80 in 143 days. This approach built the U-2, SR-71 Blackbird, and F-117 Nighthawk.

## We Work in the Open - Like Real Craftsmen

**Everything is transparent.** When you submit a ticket, it's public. Everyone can see what needs fixing, what's being worked on, and who suggested it. No backdoor deals, no buried suggestions, no corporate BS.

This is open source - the digital version of working with the shop door open. Anyone can see the work being done, and **you get credit for your contributions**.

## Two Ways to Submit

### 1. The Simple Form
Submit your ticket through the form. Goes straight to the backlog. Your name on it.

### 2. Direct to GitHub (For the Tech-Savvy)
GitHub is where the actual build happens. Think of it as our digital workshop - all the blueprints, all the work, all out in the open.

## How This Works

**The Backlog = The Public Build List**
- Every suggestion is visible to everyone
- Your coworkers can upvote/support your idea
- Management can't bury inconvenient truths
- Credit goes where credit's due

**The Sprint = 2-4 Week Build Cycles**
We grab the most important items and build them. Just like Skunk Works' rapid prototyping - build, test, improve, repeat.

**Your Name Stays On It**
When your suggestion gets implemented, your name is attached. This isn't anonymous - it's honest men identifying real problems and getting recognition for it.

## How to Submit Your Ticket

### Keep It Simple and Honest
**Problem**: What's broken or needs improving
**Impact**: How it affects the work
**Solution** (optional): Your idea to fix it

### Example Ticket
"Inventory scanner times out after 30 seconds. Need 2 minutes minimum for large shipments. Happens 5-10 times per shift. Costing 20 minutes daily in re-scans. - Submitted by John Smith, Warehouse 3"

## Why Open Source Matters

**No Hidden Agenda**
Everyone sees what's being worked on. If safety issues keep getting ignored while cosmetic stuff gets fixed, everyone knows.

**Shared Knowledge**
Other companies using the same systems can see our improvements. We can see theirs. Rising tide lifts all boats.

**Your Reputation**
Good suggestions with your name on them. When you solve a problem that's been bugging everyone for months, people know who fixed it.

## The Bottom Line

This isn't a suggestion box where ideas disappear. It's an open workshop where:
- Every idea is public and credited
- Popular problems get fixed first
- Your name stays on your contributions
- No bureaucrat can bury the truth

Submit the ticket. Put your name on it. Stand behind your idea. Get the credit when it makes everyone's job better.
