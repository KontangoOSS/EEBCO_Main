We believe energy efficiency opportunities should be available to all communities and all sizes of businesses, from solo contractors to large corporations.

### 7. **Data-Driven Advocacy**
Our positions are based on facts, research, and member experience — not ideology. We use real market data to drive policy decisions.

### 8. **Continuous Innovation**
We embrace new technologies, business models, and approaches that advance the energy efficiency industry.
