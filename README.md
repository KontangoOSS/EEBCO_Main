The Energy Efficiency Business Coalition (EEBC) is a statewide trade association of non-utility companies that provide energy efficiency, demand response, and data analytics products and services in Colorado. Founded in 2008, EEBC's member businesses include demand-side management implementation and evaluation experts, demand response companies, engineering and architecture firms, data analytics firms, contractors, financing experts, commercial energy service companies, workforce training entities, and manufacturers and distributors of energy efficiency products and equipment.

EEBC is a nonprofit 501(c)(6) with a Board of Directors representing different sectors of the energy efficiency industry that services Colorado and the Southwest. Services provided by EEBC are provided through our staff, attorneys, contracted consultants, and a combination of volunteer support from the Board Directors and member companies. As a responsible organization, EEBC has professional anti-trust, conflict of interest, and client confidentiality protection policies.

OUR MISSION Our mission is to expand the energy marketplace for our member companies by advocating for programs that fund energy efficiency upgrades of homes and commercial buildings, influencing policies, and providing information on current market trends ... creating opportunities to grow your business. 

EEBC facilitates industry collaboration between energy efficiency businesses through networking opportunities and supports energy efficiency policies and programs that

Create sustainable jobs for long-term economic vitality and growth
Provide cost-effective energy while improving the environment
and public health
And, that uphold the standards for safety, quality, and professionalism
in the energy efficiency industry.
WHAT WE DO

EEBC is the primary voice advocating for businesses in the energy efficiency and demand response industry
EEBC provides credible, effective representation for the energy efficiency industry at the legislature, Governor's office, Public Utility Commission, Colorado Energy Office, and other government agencies
EEBC deep dives into proceedings at the Public Utility Commission to fight for funding and financial incentives for energy efficiency products and services for homes and commercial buildings.
We serve as a cover organization to deliver messages to utilities and other organizations that individual companies might not be able or want to do.
We keep members informed through quarterly membership meetings, committees, newsletters, and legislative briefs, and an internal Members Only section of the changing business environment in Colorado and the Southwest so they can plan for the future.
We provide members with numerous networking opportunities throughout the year to grow their businesses.
“EEBC advocates on behalf of the energy efficiency industry at a fraction of the cost it would take us to cover these issues individually.” – Tim Jones, Controls Leader • Ingersoll Rand/Trane
