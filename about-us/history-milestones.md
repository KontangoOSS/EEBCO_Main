# 📜 EEBC History & Milestones

## Building Colorado's Energy Efficiency Industry Since 2007

---

## 🌱 The Beginning (2007)

### Why EEBC Was Founded

In 2007, Colorado's energy efficiency industry faced a critical challenge: **dozens of businesses were working in isolation** while major policy and program decisions were being made without their input. 

**The Problem:**
- Utilities designing programs without contractor input
- Policies created without understanding business impacts
- No unified voice for the industry
- Missed opportunities for growth
- Fragmented market with no coordination

**The Solution:** 
A group of forward-thinking business leaders came together to form the Energy Efficiency Business Coalition — **the first and only organization in the nation** focused primarily on increasing the business potential of the energy efficiency industry at the local level.

### Founding Principles
- Business prosperity drives market transformation
- Collective voice achieves more than individual efforts
- Local expertise matters in policy development
- Contractors are the backbone of energy efficiency
